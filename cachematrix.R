## The functions in this file contains implementation
## of caching an inverse of a matrix.


## The function creates a special "matrix" object 
## that can cache its inverse.
makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## The function retrieve inverse of the matrix from the cache
## or computes it.
cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
